                          <h2>As a Child...</h2>
                          <p>I used to be obsessed with America. My parents often watched "Friends" so I think that's where I got this feeling of sincere love towards the country I've never been to.</p>
                          <p>At the age of 19 I saved up my first 1000$ and flew to the US for my New Year. The biggest dream I had at that period of life came true.</p>

                          <h2>Career Out of Nowhere</h2>
                          <p>I liked learning English. It was just fun and nothing more. Somehow I couldn't find a better thing to do but learn new words and mimic the articulation of native English speakers in front of the mirror.</p>
                          <p>By the age of 15 I got a solid vocabulary and nice pronunciation. It was then that I got offered a job as a teacher. I never saw it coming. </p>
