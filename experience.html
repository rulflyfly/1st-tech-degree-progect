              <h2>The Story</h2>
              <p>I have been self-taught to teach.</p>
              <p>When I was 15 I could speak English already and a friend of a friend was impressed by it and asked me to work with children at his school. That's how I got my first job.</p>
              <p>When it was time to get my bachelors I went for a linguistic degree at Kazan State University but quit on the third year and moved to Moscow to work at a school and to figure out what education and job suit me best in the future.</p>
              <p>I changed a couple of schools and ended up being a private tutor to have more control over my finances and over whom and how I teach</p>
