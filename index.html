        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm an English language teacher who got super bored with her job. I decided to change my career completely and become a web developer. I love learning and getting new experiences. It happened so that at this point in life learning how to code is most fun for me.</p>
        <p>I live in Moscow now but I don't feel that I'll stay here for very long. I've traveled a lot and it seems that I could find lots of opportunities to grow if I move abroad.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to be really good at building web pages and online applications. For that I know I have to master:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I aim to work at a web design company. But I believe the more I learn the better understanding I'll have on what's out there. Maybe I'll have many other job preferences as I mature.</p>
